### ✅ **Step-by-Step: Installing Go on Windows**

#### **1. Visit the Go official website**

- Go to: [https://golang.org](https://golang.org/) (or it's redirected site: [https://go.dev](https://go.dev/))
    
- You’ll see the **Go gopher mascot** and a **“Download Go”** button.
    

#### **2. Click the “Download Go” button**

- This takes you to the downloads page:  
    📦 [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
    

#### **3. Choose the correct installer for your OS**

- For Windows, download the **MSI Installer** for 64-bit:
    
    ```
    go1.x.x.windows-amd64.msi
    ```
    
- Make sure to download the **latest stable version**.
    

#### **4. Run the Installer**

- Double-click the downloaded `.msi` file.
    
- Windows might show a warning (e.g., from antivirus). Allow it to run.
    

#### **5. Installation Wizard**

- A standard installer will guide you:
    
    - Click **Next**
        
    - Choose install location (default is usually fine):  
        `C:\Program Files\Go`
        
    - Click **Install** and then **Finish**
        

#### **6. Verify Installation (After Install)**

Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** and type:

```bash
go version
```

You should see something like:

```bash
go version go1.x.x windows/amd64
```

If that appears — 🎉 Go is installed correctly!

### 🧪 Bonus: Try Online Playground (Optional)

On [https://go.dev/play](https://go.dev/play/), there's a **yellow box** where you can:

- Type Go code
    
- Click **Run**
    
- See output (compiled and run remotely)
    

But this is just for testing — you'll use **your local installation** for full development.
